NodeJSBlog
==========

Blog implementation with Node.js using Express, Mongodb as database system, Twig as template engine and Socket.io to communicate with the server.

It's a basic example. The server is hosted in a ec2 instance of Amazon Web Services, so you can see how to configure. See screen command to make the Node.js always be running. The page has a Welcome page, a tutorial page where you can see the main functions I have used and the blog itself.

The blog hasn't access control, so everybody can write a post.  Enjoy!
